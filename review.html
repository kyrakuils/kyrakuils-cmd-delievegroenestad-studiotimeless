            I chose L'etoile Luxury Vintage store, because I always love designer bags, although I think it's a lot of
            money
            for a beautiful bag. That is why I think Vintage designer bags are a good but also sustainable alternative.
            I
            visited the store and was surrounded by beautiful bags with designer brands such as Chanel, Hermes, etc.
            What I
            didn't know is that the store also sells accessories and clothing such as jewelry from Dior.
        </p>

        <p class="review-text2">
            Because I had not found much information about L'etoile on their website, I asked the store staff. They
            helped
            me very kindly and informed me about the store and the concept.
        </p>

        <p class="review-text3">
            The store itself was clear. All bags were sorted by brand and color, which also created a kind of luxurious
            vibe.
        </p>

        <p class="review-text4">
            Even though I personally find the original and the vintage bags on the expensive side, I compared it with
            the
            original prices and could conclude that it is a lot cheaper.
        </p>

        <p class="review-text5">
            The bags are 100% authentic, unique designer bags and have often only been worn once or twice and therefore
            have
            no damage to it.
        </p>

        <p class="review-text6">
            I came to L'etoile Luxury Vintage because of influencers and my interest in designer bags. I heard that
            influencers were often allowed to borrow bags. Borrowing is of course super sustainable, because you return
            the
            bag and resell it.
        </p>

        <p class="review-text7">
            Unfortunately, L'etoile only lends out bags for collaborations with influencers, for example, so they must
            then
            return the bags to the store. In my opinion I think it would be a cool concept not only for collaborations
            but
            also for regular clients.
        </p>

        <p class="review-text8">
            L' etoile Luxury Vintage began to sell upcycled bags, these are bags that have been made by an artist
            especially
            for their company, so not by the brand itself. The bags are made from the paper bags and dust bags that you
            receive when you make a purchase from the brand. This way you have a more affordable designer bag and is
            therefore sustainable.
